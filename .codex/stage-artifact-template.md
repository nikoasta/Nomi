# Summary

Short outcome summary.

# Scope / Routing

Record the assigned write zone, success criteria, selected docs, selected skills, selected agents, catalog candidates, model/reasoning choice, parallel group, and dependency boundaries.

# Verification

List the commands that were actually run and the result.

# Delivery / Cleanup

Record how the orchestrator accepted or rejected the stream, then record the safe-only cleanup result. Use `accepted-content, not-git-merged; manual cleanup required` when work was accepted through cherry-pick or manual integration but the child branch is not Git-merged.

# Risks / Follow-ups / Explicit Defers

List residual risks, blockers, explicit next steps, and any justified defer.
Do not leave silent technical debt behind this artifact.
